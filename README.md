# ADDE FrontEnd Test

Welcome to the ADDE Frontend Technical Test. In this test, you will need to create a small frontend application using the technologies that we at ADDE use in our daily routine.

## Stack

In this test, we encourage you tu use the technologies that we use in our daily basis:

-   [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
-   [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
-   [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
-   [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

If you want to use other technologies or add features in order to enhance your application (such as TypeScript, Redux, Jest, Enzyme, responsive design), you are more than welcome to do so.

# The Test

In this test, you will need to create a small game based on movies currently in theaters in France.
Users will need to guess the movie based on the poster and the title of the movie. Then, they can click on the poster to see details about the movie.

You will need to use the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) in order to fetch the movies.

You will need an API key in order to execute these requests. You can get one [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

# Rules

-   We strongly suggest that you use the technologies suggested under the Stack section. If you want to use another technology such as Angular JS or Vue JS because you do not know React, you can do so, but take into consideration that we do not use them in our daily basis.
-   If you want to use your own boilerplate, feel free to override the whole repository.
-   Keep in mind several aspects of the application, not only functionality. Such as accessibility, performance, usability, maintainability, scalability.
-   This test should take you a day to complete, if you need more time or if you have any questions, please reach out to ADDE.
-   In order to deliver the project, please create a public GitHub repository and upload your code to it.

# Setup

in order to start the project, you will need to install the dependencies using `npm install` and then run the project using `npm run dev`. This will start the project in `localhost:5173` in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
